# Around The US Project

Description: Showcases Jacques Cousteau's photography as an explorer around the US in a gallery using grid display and responsive layouts.

Techniques: BEM method for consistency and legibility, grid display for stucture, media queries for responsive layouts. This means the css or style of the webpage changes based on the size of the user's screen for a better experience across differently sized devices. Jacques is also able to add more photos, change names and descriptions without disrupting the display.

Thank you so much for your help! I learned a lot from this sprint. I will remember to use more advanced ways of wrting html and css even though some other ways might show the same visual result because the more advanced ways are much simpler to read and fix potential issues. 

I hope all of the problems are now fixed. I double checked the dev tools for horizontal scroll and I do not see it anywhere now, unless the screen is super small. The desktop view for the 320 width screen looks weird, but the mobile view looks good.
