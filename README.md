# Around The US Project

Description: Showcases Jacques Cousteau's photography as an explorer around the US in a gallery using grid display and responsive layouts.

Techniques: BEM method for consistency and legibility, grid display for stucture, media queries for responsive layouts. This means the css or style of the webpage changes based on the size of the user's screen for a better experience across differently sized devices. Jacques is also able to add more photos, change names and descriptions without disrupting the display.
